Future deployment may come in the form of nginx. Looking further into it and learning how to. For now, converted it to a client-side rendered create-react-app and deployed on Heroku.

(Excuse all my commits, I've been trying to deploy this server-rendered React code on many platforms in vain; I'm not ususally like this I swear)
